    compile with the <code>g++ -o main main.cpp</code> command and run with <code>./main</code>
   </dd>
</d1>

# Algorithms
<p>There are three algorithms to solve the puzzle:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uniform Cost Search</li>
<li>A* with Misplaced Tile Heuristic</li>
<li>A* with Manhattan Distance Heuristic</li>
</ul>

<p>When running the program, follow the directions on the console exactly. When entering a custom puzzle please include a space between each number and hit enter when a complete row has been entered. If a solution is found from a valid user input, the program will display the total nodes expanded, the max nodes in the queue, and the depth of the solution.  </p>
